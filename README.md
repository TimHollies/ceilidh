# Experimental YAML ceilidh dance format

This is an attempt to develop a yaml-based schema which is general enough to represent all folk dance.. It has a long way to go. 

## Feature ideas
- Macros for 'roles' to make it easy for the caller to switch out male/female for whatever terms they choose. If the calling cards are electronic then this could be decided at the venue to match with features. (e.g person nearest the bar instead of 'Lady').
- Some way of highlighting the key moves in each dance to help callers develop varied programmes
